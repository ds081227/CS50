Hello world, this is Kenny from Hong Kong, and this is my CS50P final project.
This program is designed for my friend to generate a 5 week schedule for 12 teams
in a basketball fantasy league. In the past he needs to draw lots manually, which is not
efficient and also waste of paper. That's why I wrote this program for him so that he can generate
the schedule in just one click.
Before executing the program, the user first needs to enter the team names inside the teams.txt
file according to their ranking base on results from previous weeks. Make sure you enter
exactly 12 teams, if you enter more or less than 12 teams, the program will show a
error message saying invalid number of teams.
Next you have to make sure the font file msjh.tff is inside the same directory as the program.
when you run the program, it will download this font file msjh.ttf for you
The reason for
using this font file is because this font can successfully output the pdf if there are non-English
words in the team name.
And now you can run the program in the terminal window, and a pdf file called schedule will be
generated. As you can see here here, the pdf file contains all 5 weeks schedule. I will
run it a few more times to show that the schedule are randomly generated. and that's it
for my program, thank you.
