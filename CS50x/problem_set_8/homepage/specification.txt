HTML Tags:
<div> <p> <h1> <h2> <button> <nav> <link> <script>  <a> <meta>

CSS Properties:
color, background-color, margin, text-align, height, z-index

Javascript implementation:
I implemented JavaScript for my navigation bar to insert it into every html page that I
createdso that I only need to change the bar in one place if I decide to add more tabs
into my website.

I also use i on the draw.html page to create a expanded image box to let the users see
my drawings more clearly in a higher resolution.
